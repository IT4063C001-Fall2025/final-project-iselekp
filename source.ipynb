    "‚ÄúLight pollution limits the visibility of [the] milky way to the unaided eye, the [visibility] of nebulae and galaxies seen in telescopes, and raises the noise on CCD astrophotographs. Only the observation of planets and double stars is unaffected. Low light pollution conditions, or dark skies, is one of the most important properties of a good [astronomical] observing site.‚Äù Attilla Danko\n",
    "\n",
    "With the expansion of industrial areas and human settlements, the amount of light and air pollution across Earth is increasing, so the areas with good astronomical observing are dwindling even assuming consistent weather patterns. Therefore, I would like to analyze several variables across Earth‚Äôs surface that impact astronomical viewing and identify the best regions. Amateur and professional astronomers can make the best observations in those regions and potentially petition for dark sky preserves in those regions to ensure future generations can view the cosmos in their full beauty. \n"
